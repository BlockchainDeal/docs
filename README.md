## How to Contribute to ARK Documentation

This guide describes how to write and submit documentation to ARK docs. If you would like to write on a specific topic, please visit our project https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/docs/projects/1  page to choose a topic (you can see which are to-do and which are ongoing). Get in touch with ‘boldninja’ in [ARK Slack](https://ark.io/slack) to apply for specific section, send your previous work (if applicable) and to confirm if the topic has been taken.

When your topic has been accepted, you are ready to follow the steps in this guide, and contribute to the documentation.

## Formatting and general layout
All the guides and content must be in [markdown structure and format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown). Keep your folder structure organized (include assets folder where you will add images, keep the main markdown files on the root level of your folder, do not split the guide into more files).

Please follow the general structure, and add your topics in between. The general structure must consist of:

- Introduction
- Before you begin section (with possible links to previous content)
- Your content (free to organize according to your preferences)
- Conclusion (with next steps and links to other content, if available)

## How to submit new documentation or guide
Fork the ARK docs repository. All of our guides are stored in the github.com/ARKEcosystem/docs repository. You will need to clone forked repository to your local computer. Check the project tasks, to see which guides are already in progress and what is still free. Please make sure your topic or guide is accepted first, before continuing to work on it. After you are done with your work submit a pull-request with your content at https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/docs/pulls, we’ll review it and get back to you.


>This is not “first come, first serve”. All submissions will be reviewed and quality matters more than quantity.

For more information about using Git, refer to the official Git documentation. If you're a Git beginner, both GitHub and GitLab offer excellent primers to get you started.
