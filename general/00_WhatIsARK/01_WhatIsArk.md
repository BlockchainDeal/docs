# Welcome to Ark.

ARK provides users, developers, and start-ups with innovative Blockchain technologies. We aim to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a virtual spiderweb of endless use-cases that make ARK highly flexible, adaptable, and scalable. ARK is a secure platform designed for mass adoption and will deliver the services that consumers want and developers need.

Everyone can use Ark as a digital and cryptographically secured payment method, with lightning fast transaction speeds. But that’s only breaking the surface of this Blockchain. Beyond that there is a blend of technologies that make Ark’s vision unique and unlike any other cryptocurrency or Blockchain out there.
Features like:
-    Smartbridge Technology - The ability to communicate and utilize the advantages and technologies of other blockchains.
-    Push Button Deployment – To customize and create a new blockchain and token with a few mouse clicks.
-    arkVM – Solidity Smart Contracts in a highly scalable environment with low fees.
-    Delegated Proof of Stake – The consensus algorithm that has been adapted and optimized by Ark to have transaction times of 8 seconds in a decentralized environment where every Ark token owner has a proportional voice in the decision making of the network with the chance of earning Block rewards for stakeholding.
-    Ark Internet-of-Things Devices – Different kind of Internet-of-Things devices which are compatible with the Ark Ecosystem and will enhance daily lives in a way never before seen.
-    Easy-to-use: The wallet has no loading times and works right away without needing to download the whole Blockchain. All User interfaces are kept as clear and simple as possible.

The fast transaction times, ability to scale without limits, and an ecosystem of blockchains that can all talk to one another gives ARK all the tools needed to bring Blockchains to a new level. In the following episodes you’ll also see that one of Ark’s biggest advantages is its end-user friendly architecture.
